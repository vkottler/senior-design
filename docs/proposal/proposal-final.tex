\section{Abstract}

This document serves as the formal, semester-project proposal to be vetted by
the course instructor:
\HREF{https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Krachey_Joe/}{Joe Krachey}.
We have additional
\HREF{https://fault-tolerant-quadcopter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}
{online documentation} that we plan to keep in sync with our project's scope
and current progress.

\section{Executive Summary}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Seemingly no ``multi-vehicle fleet'' or autonomous-flight capable drone
technology is available to interact with in the consumer market. Similarly,
open-source hardware and software in the ``DIY drone'' ecosystem cannot be
easily converted or augmented to solve that problem.

We identified this problem while exploring learning objectives...

To gain relevant experience with aerospace problem spaces, it's necessary
to design, test and build a custom flying machine.

\subsection{Proposal}

We intend to build a \textbf{quadcopter} plus
\textbf{ground station} and \textbf{web-based user interface}.
We have chosen to call this project the
\textbf{fault-tolerant quadcopter}. This name reveals one of our
design goals that will be covered in a future section. 

With respect to the problem statement (and single-semester timeline), we do
not anticipate delivering a polished technical solution to any of the specific
deficiencies we identify in the ``free and open-source'' ecosystem. We have
tentatively planned to continue working on this project until our source
repository \HREF{https://github.com/vkottler/senior-design}{on GitHub}...

\subsection{Concept of Operation}

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:conops}} TODO.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4in]{../src/im/conops}
	\caption{The intended physical configuration.}
	\label{fig:conops}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Overview}

This project is designed for three major bodies of work that were
mentioned above but are better captured by \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:high-level}}:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../src/im/top_level}
	\caption{High-level overview of the major components and
		their interfaces.}
	\label{fig:high-level}
\end{figure}

\noindent This high-level architecture is inspired by existing aerospace
avionics and software systems that we have done research on
and have some first-hand experience with. Our current, collective
experience with such systems (and the technical challenges we
anticipate being associated with them) is minimal, though. For
this reason \textbf{we seek feedback on our lower-level goals and
approach}, provided that this high-level idea suffices as
a project worth pursuing.

\section{Technical Features}

A vehicle that is \textit{single-fault tolerant} is capable of continuing
nominal operation after experiencing any arbitrary failure in a well-defined
\textit{fault space}. We aim to implement single-fault tolerance by:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Limiting the initial fault space to a ``loss of ground station
		heartbeat'' event
	\item Executing a ``landing maneuver'' upon fault detection
	\item Iteratively hardening our design to a broader fault space,
		time permitting
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We recognize some intermediate milestones that will need to be reached
before an \textit{automatic flight-termination system} described above can be
expected to function:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Establish wireless communication between the vehicle and
		ground station
	\item Establish percentage-based throttle control over each motor
	\item Establish manual-commanding capability to the vehicle from a
		web-based user interface
	\item View live telemetry from a web-based user interface
	\item Sense angular velocity via gyroscope and force experienced via
		inertial measurement unit
	\item Develop a control algorithm to fly in a stable hover or
		holding pattern
	\item Extend control algorithm to control for velocity in three axes
		to achieve controlled motion
	\item Sense relative altitude
	\item Extend control algorithm to control for a specific \textit{delta-y}
		(perpendicular to ground plane) 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Our limited understanding of control theory and lack of experience in
general with avionics systems may limit what we can achieve in the end, but we
recognize this and have focused on primarily \textit{system-level} goals and
requirements versus specific technical requirements (battery life, thrust and
payload capability, etc.).

	\textit{``A problem well stated is a problem half
	solved.'' - Charles Kettering}
\end{quote}

\noindent Distribution of work and responsibilities has been discussed and the
following summaries represent a consensus reached on initial roles and task
delegation.

\section{Project Management}

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes
	thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about
	solutions.'' - Albert Einstein}
\end{quote}

\noindent The value of detailed (but \textit{precise}!) planning for a project
of this scope and timeline cannot be overstated. Prototyping and experimenting
is inevitable but must be guided to avoid allocating disproportionate effort
towards minor goals that put higher-level goals at risk.
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:workflow_1}} introduces our approach and
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:workflow_2}} establishes a proposed process for
handling integration and final stages in project realization.
